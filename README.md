# FileBridge

FileBridge is a secure file transfer platform that enables end-to-end encrypted file sharing. Built with modern web technologies, it ensures your files remain private and secure throughout the entire transfer process.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js with Material-UI components
- **Backend**: Flask (Python) REST API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for secure file metadata storage
- **Security**: Web Crypto API for client-side encryption

## Features

- üîí End-to-end encryption using AES-GCM
- üì§ Secure file upload with password protection
- üì• Password-protected file downloads
- üìÅ Support for both single files and folders
- üóëÔ∏è Secure file deletion
- üîë API token authentication for additional security

## Security Implementation

### End-to-End Encryption

FileBridge implements robust end-to-end encryption using the following security measures:

1. **Client-Side Encryption**:
   - Files are encrypted on the client side before upload using AES-GCM (Advanced Encryption Standard in Galois/Counter Mode)
   - A unique 256-bit encryption key is derived from your password using PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2)
   - Each file uses a unique 12-byte Initialization Vector (IV) for enhanced security
   - The encryption process uses 100,000 iterations of SHA-256 hashing for key derivation

2. **Server-Side Security**:
   - Files are stored in their encrypted form on the server
   - The server never has access to the decryption keys
   - Additional server-side encryption using Fernet (symmetric encryption) for stored files
   - API token authentication required for all operations

3. **Secure File Transfer**:
   - Files are transmitted over HTTPS
   - The original file is never stored in its unencrypted form
   - Decryption only happens on the client side after download

## Technical Details

### Encryption Process

1. **Upload Process**:
   - User selects a file and provides an encryption password
   - System generates a random salt
   - Password is used with PBKDF2 to derive a 256-bit AES key
   - File is encrypted using AES-GCM with a random IV
   - Encrypted file, salt, and IV are sent to the server

2. **Download Process**:
   - User requests file download and provides the decryption password
   - System retrieves the encrypted file, salt, and IV from the server
   - Password is used with the stored salt to derive the same AES key
   - File is decrypted client-side using AES-GCM
   - Decrypted file is available for download

## Security Best Practices

- Always use strong passwords for file encryption
- Keep your API tokens secure
- Never share your encryption passwords
- Delete files after they're no longer needed
- Use HTTPS for all connections
